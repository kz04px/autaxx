### About
Autaxx is a C++ engine for the board game Ataxx. It uses traditional alphabeta methods such as null move pruning, killer moves, and a transposition table.

### Build instructions

git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kz04px/autaxx
follow the libataxx build instructions
mkdir ./autaxx/build
cd ./autaxx/build
cmake ..
make
```

### UAI protocol
UAI stands for "Universal Ataxx Interface" and is a slightly modified version of the Universal Chess Interface protocol.
The only differences are that instances of 'c' for 'chess' have been replaced by 'a' for 'ataxx', and that the [FEN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsythâ€“Edwards_Notation) format has been altered to suit the game.

---
### FEN strings
"x" are player one's pieces. "o" are player two's pieces. Numbers represent the number of empty squares. Dashes represent blocked squares. The final character shows the current side to play.<br/>
Examples:
>x5o/7/7/7/7/7/o5x x 0 1<br/>
>x5o/7/2-1-2/7/2-1-2/7/o5x x 0 1

---
### Play without a GUI
Autaxx supports the 'manual' mode that should be more suitable for entering commands manually than the UAI protocol.
A board will be printed in text and moves can be entered with chess-like algebraic notation e.g. g1g3, b6, etc
